            Death is a taboo in most societies in the world.
             But what if we have got this completely wrong? What if death was not a
            catastrophe that it is made to be, 
            but an essential aspect of life, rife with spiritual possibilities for transcendence?
            For the first time, someone is saying just that.  <br> <br>
            Whether a believer or a disbeliever, a devotee or an agnostic, an accomplished seeker or a simpleton, this is truly a
            book for all those who shall die!
